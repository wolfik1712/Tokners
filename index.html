					the
					ability to trade with other communities in order to gain access to more creator content with early token

				<h2>What makes us different?</h2>
				<h3>We would only launch tokens with the express permission of the creators. </h3>
				<h4>There are several thousand celebrities and creators on twitter, tiktok, Instagram and YouTube with
					followings
					in the millions who we would be actively engaging before we go viral.</h4>
				<h4>We would get them on our platform and they would see the opportunity to create a fan driven digital
					economy
					where their digital content can be traded as NFTs and their most loyal fans can have the monetary value
					of
					their creator's currency increase significantly as they promote their digital currency across their
					channels
					while our native token holders benefit from the Weentar popularity.</h4>

					<h2>Cryptocurrency adoption is at less than 1% of the global world population with some countries and
						entities actively fighting against its mass adoption and the smartest developers and nerds holding the
						fort.
					</h2>
					<h3>Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of tokens launched all aiming to fix one
						problem or the other with some quite simply FOMOing the moment. Our goal is to bring mass adoption to
						the
						cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far down? So down that even a celebrity can explain it in
						simple words to their followers and have them download an app, buy into the social currency of their
						favourite person and watch their
						investment as is with other crypto currency project.
					</h3>
					<h4>We are trying to do to this space what investment apps did for the "nonexistent retail investors". We
						are gamefying digital currency, bringing in popular faces instead of hard to understand projects to
						make
						it the norm and inadvertently being the "gateway drug" for a lot of people to finally give this space
						a
						real look. </h4>

					<h2>A new digital economy is coming. People would be just as powerful as countries and creators would be

					<h3>There would be new markets and advertisers with little to offer would not find home there. Like Kanye

					<h2>Well, Kanye didn't exactly say that, but it sounds like something we hope he would say.</h2>
					<h3>Currency is digital, it has been that way for a while now, but this time there would be no dead
						presidents on the money, there would people like you on the money, and you would own it because it
						would
						make the most sense in the world.</h3>
